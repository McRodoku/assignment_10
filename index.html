  <h1>Why I like Spider-Man</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="main-container">
    <p>Spider-Man is an iconic comic book character from the Marvel universe. He was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962. He's one of the most popular comic book characters in history.
    He also happens to be my favorite comic book character, and this is why.</p>

  <div class="main-container">
    <p>In my opinion, Spider-Man stands out as an exceptional comic book character for a multitude of reasons. What sets him apart is his relatability. Beneath the mask, Peter Parker is an 
      ordinary person grappling with the challenges of everyday life, like school, work, and maintaining his relationships. This aspect makes Spider-Man feel closer to me, as his struggles 
      have at times mirrored my own. Unlike many superheroes, Spider-Man doesn't hail from a distant planet or possess god-like powers, making him more accessible and relatable. This relatability 
      creates a unique connection with the audience, allowing us to see a bit of ourselves in the character. <p>

      <p>What I find equally compelling is Spider-Man's remarkable character development. From his humble beginnings as a shy and nerdy teenager, Peter Parker undergoes a profound transformation into a responsible 
        and selfless hero. His journey is both inspiring and enduring, showcasing the resilience of the human spirit. Spider-Man's personal growth is complemented by a diverse and iconic rogues' gallery, featuring 
        some of the most memorable villains in comic book history like Venom, Green Goblin, and Doctor Octopus. The complex interplay between hero and villain adds depth to Spider-Man's narrative, making him a 
        multifaceted and timeless character that will likely continue to resonate across generations like he has for the past 60 years.</p>
